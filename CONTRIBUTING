This book has been written under a specific creative-commons license, with a
joint copyright between Heroku (https://www.heroku.com/) and the author (Fred
Hebert), agreed upon as part of his work functions.

The copyright situation isn't simple enough for the author to handle all
implications and subtleties, and while this repository is open source and under
a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
license, *it cannot be considered as Free as in Freedom*.

Contributions are therefore not going to be accepted as pull requests modifying
any significant piece of content, since this would introduce more authors into
the arrangement in an ad-hoc manner the author is not ready or able to deal
with.

Readers are free to ask questions, point out typos, recommend improvements, ask
for new topics to be covered, point out bugs, help with support of more end
formats than PDF, and so on. However, as a technicality, actually making
changes of any significant effect to the text or formatting should be done by
the author or Heroku employees to avoid making a confusing copyright situation
even more confusing than it is right now.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
