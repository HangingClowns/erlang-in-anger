EPUB:

- Introduction and Conclusion unlinked in ToC. Likely due to using
  \chapter*{...} instead of \chapter{...} for these.

Couldn't figure out how to fix it yet without renumbering all chapters,
which sucks. The information is lost at the HTML level.

- In lists of processes properties in chapter 5, nested lists are made
  flat and lose their existing hierarchy/nesting, making content hard to
  read

Have not yet figured this one out. Information is left at the HTML
level.

- Same in the list in 5.3. In fact, the small section titles used to
  break up lists disappear and only the lists remain.

Actually there's a nested list in 5.3 that's nested right at the HTML
level and also at the EPUB level.

I'm guessing what is lost here are the <dl> lists, but the rest is fine.
That may sadly require some fancypants patching, but I'll look into it.

- Chapter 6 footnotes 6 and 7 have invalid refs (??)

Haven't figured it out yet, lost at the HTML level.
