EPUB:

- Introduction and Conclusion unlinked in ToC. Likely due to using
  \chapter*{...} instead of \chapter{...} for these.

Couldn't figure out how to fix it yet without renumbering all chapters,
which sucks. The information is lost at the HTML level.

- Chapter 6 footnotes 6 and 7 have invalid refs (??)

Haven't figured it out yet, lost at the HTML level.

- Links to chapters, subsections, section refs, and figures appear broken

No idea. Works in HTML. ToC also works.
The references of the form <CLASS:TERM> are preservec in \ref usage, but the
 initial \label pieces are gone
