# README

This book intends to be a little guide about how to be the Erlang medic in a
time of war. It is first and foremost a collection of tips and tricks to help
understand where failures come from, and a dictionary of different code
snippets and practices that helped developers debug production systems that
were built in Erlang.

This is the source repository for the book.
